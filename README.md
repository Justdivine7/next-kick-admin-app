NextKick Admin ⚙️

NextKick Admin is the internal management application used to operate, moderate, and scale the NextKick football platform.

This app is not customer-facing. It exists to give administrators full visibility and control over players, teams, content, and competitive data within the ecosystem.

🎯 Purpose

As NextKick grows, operational complexity increases:

More players consuming training content

More teams joining tournaments

More data that must remain accurate, fair, and moderated

NextKick Admin centralizes all platform operations into one controlled interface.

🔐 Access & Roles

The admin app is restricted to authorized personnel only.

Administrators can:

Monitor platform activity

Manage users and content

Ensure data integrity across the system

Role-based permissions can be introduced as the platform scales.
